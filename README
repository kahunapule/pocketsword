Developers should use Jira bug tracking tool at http://www.crosswire.org/tracker/browse/PS.

Code should compile on the latest Xcode (document last updated when it was at 6.0.1) with nothing else special besides what is in this repo.

There are long todo lists and feel free to contact me if you want to help out and access them!

That's all, enjoy. :)
